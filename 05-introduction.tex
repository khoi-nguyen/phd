\chapter{Introduction}

The introduction of the Euclidean \emph{Fourier Transform} is often motivated
by its action on differential operators,
especially those with constant coefficients.
This is due to the fact that every ingredient used to define the Fourier Transform,
from the Lebesgue measure to the complex exponentials,
respects the \emph{group structure} of $(\R^n, +)$.
