\section{The Euclidean case}

Given a partial differential operator
\begin{align*}
    T = \sum_{\abs \alpha \leq N} c_\alpha(x) \iD{x^\alpha}
\end{align*}
with smooth coefficients,
let us recall that its \emph{characteristic polynomial} is given by the smooth map
\begin{align*}
    \sigma(x, \xi) \defeq \sum_{\abs \alpha \leq N} c_\alpha(x) \xi^\alpha.
\end{align*}

Substituing $\iD{{x_i} }$ for $\xi_i$ might, formally speaking, seem like a trivial and insignificant change,
it is however good to keep in mind
that smooth functions have their own operations and structures
which could provide us with a different perspective.

Note that the composition and adjunction of such operators can be written in terms of their characteristic polynomials.
As an example,
if $T_1$ and $T_2$ are two operators arising from the polynomials $\sigma_1(x, \xi)$ and $\sigma_2(x, \xi)$ via
\begin{align*}
    T_1 \defeq \sum_{\abs \alpha \leq N} \frac 1 {\alpha!} \iD{\xi^\alpha} \sigma_1(x, 0) \iD{x^\alpha}
    \quad
    T_2 \defeq \sum_{\abs \alpha \leq N} \frac 1 {\alpha!} \iD{\xi^\alpha} \sigma_2(x, 0) \iD{x^\alpha},
\end{align*}
then it follows from an elementary computation
that the characteristic polynomial of $T_1 \circ T_2$ is given by the finite sum
\begin{align}
    (\sigma_1 \circ \sigma_2)(x, \xi) = \sum_{\alpha \in \N^n} \frac 1 {\alpha!} \iD{\xi^\alpha} \sigma_1(x, \xi) \iD{x^\alpha} \sigma_2(x, \xi)
    \label{eq:composition_formula_for_characteristic_polynomials},
\end{align}
while the adjoint of $T \defeq T_1$ arises from
\begin{align}
    \sigma^{(*)}(x, \xi) = \sum_{\alpha \in \N^n} \frac 1 {\alpha!} \iD{\xi^\alpha} \iD{x^\alpha} \adj{\sigma(x, \xi)},
    \label{eq:adjunction_formula_for_characteristic_polynomials}
\end{align}
where in the above $\sigma \defeq \sigma_1$.

\subsection{Symbolic point of view}

We observe that
the terms appearing in the sums~\eqref{eq:composition_formula_for_characteristic_polynomials} or~\eqref{eq:adjunction_formula_for_characteristic_polynomials} make sense for smooth functions $\sigma \in \SmoothFunctions {\R^n \times \R^n}$ that are not necessarily characteristic polynomials.
A natural question is thus the following:
can we attach each smooth function $\sigma \in \SmoothFunctions {\R^n \times \R^n}$ to a different, more general linear operator,
in such a way that both~\eqref{eq:composition_formula_for_characteristic_polynomials} and~\eqref{eq:adjunction_formula_for_characteristic_polynomials} hold?
If the answer is affirmative,
we shall see that
\eqref{eq:composition_formula_for_characteristic_polynomials} is a convenient tool to construct approximate inverse to a suitable class of operators,
justifying our approach.

Moreover,
the \emph{order} of a differential operator is more easily generalised on the ``characteristic polynomial'' side.
Naively, we could say that $\sigma \in \SmoothFunctions {\R^n \times \R^n}$ is of order $m \in \R$ if
\begin{align*}
    \sup_{(x, \xi) \in \R^n \times \R^n} \abs {\sigma(x, \xi)} \leq C (1 + \abs \xi)^m.
\end{align*}
However,
the following problems would arise.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How do we define the convergence of the sums~\eqref{eq:composition_formula_for_characteristic_polynomials} and~\eqref{eq:adjunction_formula_for_characteristic_polynomials}?
    \item Is it true that adjunction, as in~\eqref{eq:adjunction_formula_for_characteristic_polynomials}, preserves the order?
    \item Does the composition of two functions $\sigma_1$, $\sigma_2$ of order $m_1$ and $m_2$ according to~\eqref{eq:composition_formula_for_characteristic_polynomials} yield a $\sigma$ of order $m_1 + m_2$?
\end{enumerate}

It appears that all three issues can be solved by requiring
that the ``order'' of the terms in~\eqref{eq:adjunction_formula_for_characteristic_polynomials} and~\eqref{eq:composition_formula_for_characteristic_polynomials} strictly decreases as $\abs \alpha$ increases.
We are therefore led to the following definition.
\begin{definition}[Symbol classes]
    Assume $0 \leq \delta < \rho \leq 1$.
    We shall say that $\sigma \in \SmoothFunctions {\R^n \times \R^n}$ is a \emph{symbol of order $m$}
    if for each $\alpha, \beta \in \N^n$,
    there exists $C \geq 0$ such that
    \begin{align*}
        \sup_{(x, \xi) \in \R^n \times \R^n} \abs {\iD{\xi^\alpha} \iD{x^\beta}\sigma(x, \xi)} \leq C (1 + \abs \xi)^{m - \rho \abs \alpha + \delta \abs \beta}.
    \end{align*}

    The class of such symbols will be denoted by $\SymbolClass [\R^n] m {\rho, \delta}$.
    Moreover, we let
    \begin{align*}
        \SmoothingSymbols [\R^n] \defeq \bigcap_{m \in \R} \SymbolClass [\R^n] m {\rho, \delta}
    \end{align*}
    and call its elements \emph{smoothing symbols}.
\end{definition}

In order to make sense of infinite sums of symbols,
we shall use the following result,
which is proved in~\cite[Proposition~2.5.33]{RuzhanskyTurunen10}.

\begin{lemma}[Asymptotic sum of symbols]
    Given a sequence $\sigma_j \in \SymbolClass [\R^n] {m_j} {\rho, \delta}$, $j \in \N$ such that $(m_j)_{j \in \N}$ is a \emph{strictly decreasing} sequence of real numbers,
    there exists a unique symbol $\sigma \in \SymbolClass [\R^n] {m_0} {\rho, \delta}$ modulo $\SmoothingSymbols [\R^n]$ such that
    \begin{align*}
        \sigma - \sum_{j = 0}^N \sigma_j \in \SymbolClass {m_{N + 1}} {\rho, \delta},
    \end{align*}
    in which case we write
    \begin{align*}
        \sigma \sim \sum_{j = 0}^{+\infty} \sigma_j.
    \end{align*}
\end{lemma}

We are now ready to state the result
that shows the power of symbolic calculus.

\begin{theorem}[Symbolic calculus]
    Let three symbols
    $\sigma \in \SymbolClass m {\rho, \delta}$,
    $\sigma_1 \in \SymbolClass {m_1} {\rho, \delta}$,
    $\sigma_2 \in \SymbolClass {m_2} {\rho, \delta}$.
    We let
    \begin{align*}
        \sigma^{(*)}(x, \xi) &\sim \sum_{\alpha \in \N^n} \frac 1 {\alpha!} \iD{\xi^\alpha} \iD{x^\alpha} \adj{\sigma(x, \xi)}\\
        (\sigma_1 \circ \sigma_2)(x, \xi) &\sim \sum_{\alpha \in \N^n} \frac 1 {\alpha!} \iD{\xi^\alpha} \sigma_1(x, \xi) \iD{x^\alpha} \sigma_2(x, \xi),
    \end{align*}
    where the left-hand sides are thus defined modulo $\SmoothingSymbols [\R^n]$.

    The following properties hold.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The equivalence class $\sigma_1 \circ \sigma_2$ belongs to $\SymbolClass [\R^n] {m_1 + m_2} {\rho, \delta}$ modulo $\SmoothingSymbols [\R^n]$.
        \item The equivalence class $\sigma^{(*)}$ belongs to $\SymbolClass [\R^n] m {\rho, \delta}$ modulo $\SmoothingSymbols [\R^n]$.
        \item
            There exists $\sigma^{(-1)} \in \SymbolClass [\R^n] {-m} {\rho, \delta}$ such that
            \begin{align*}
                \sigma \circ \sigma^{(-1)} = 1 \quad \text{mod } \SmoothingSymbols [R^n]
            \end{align*}
            if and only if $\sigma$ is \emph{elliptic},
            i.e. there exists $c \geq 0$ and $d \geq 0$ such that
            \begin{align*}
                \abs {\sigma(x, \xi)} \geq c \abs \xi^m
            \end{align*}
            for each $x \in \R^n$ and each $\xi \in \R^n$ satisfying $\norm [\R^n] \xi \geq d$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Quantisation and pseudo-differential calculus}

While the previous subsection offers a formally attractive framework,
our efforts would only be fruitful
provided we could associate our symbols with an operator,
in a way that generalises the association of a characteristic polynomial with its corresponding differential operator.
Moreover, we will want $\sigma^{(*)}$ and $\sigma_1 \circ \sigma_2$ to correspond to the adjunction and composition of operators respectively.

As our functions $\sigma$ are now much more general,
the substitution of $\xi$ for $\iD x$ will of course not work.
However, taking advantage of the \emph{global} group structure of $\R^n$,
we easily check that the following map $\Op [\R^n]$
\begin{align}
    \Op [\R^n] (\sigma) \phi(x)
    &\defeq \int_{\R^n} \e^{\i \turn \ip [\R^n] x \xi} \sigma(x, \xi) \Fourier [\R^n] \phi(\xi) \dd \xi
    \label{eq:intro:Euclidean:quantisation}
\end{align}
not only \emph{does} send a characteristic polynomial to its corresponding partial differential operator\footnote{%
    More precisely,
    it sends a characteristic polynomial $\sigma(x, \xi) = \sum_{\alpha \in \N^n} c_\alpha(x) \xi^\alpha$ onto
    \begin{align*}
        \Op [\R^n](\sigma) \defeq \sum_{\alpha \in \N^n} (i \turn)^{-\abs \alpha} c_\alpha(x) \iD {x^\alpha}.
    \end{align*}
},
but also is far more general in scope.
The process of associating an operator with a symbol is known as \emph{quantisation}.

We are thus naturally led to the following definition.
\begin{definition}[Operator classes]
    We shall say that a map $T : \Schwartz {\R^n} \to \Schwartz {\R^n}$ is of \emph{order $m$ and type $(\rho, \delta)$} if
    \begin{align*}
        T \in \OperatorClass m {\rho, \delta}
        \defeq \Op [\R^n] \left(\SymbolClass [\R^n] m {\rho, \delta}\right).
    \end{align*}

    Moreover,
    if $T$ belongs to
    \begin{align*}
        \SmoothingOperators [\R^n] \defeq \bigcap_{m \in \R} \OperatorClass [\R^n] m {\rho, \delta},
    \end{align*}
    we shall say that $T$ is a \emph{smoothing operator}.
\end{definition}

We need to check the above define an appropriate notion of order.
Ideally, we would like to answer the following questions in the affirmative.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Does the composition of two operators of order $m_1$ and $m_2$ yield an operator of order $m_1 + m_2$?
    \item Does taking the adjoint preserve the order?
    \item Does the order control the loss of derivatives?
        By this, we mean that if $T \in \OperatorClass m {\rho, \delta}$,
        is it true that $T$ extends to a continuous map
        \begin{align*}
            T : \Sobolev [\R^n] s \to \Sobolev [\R^n] {s - m}?
        \end{align*}
\end{itemize}

The above questions are the object of the following result.
\begin{theorem}
    Assume that $1 \geq \rho > \delta \geq 0$.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If $T \in \SmoothingOperators [\R^n]$,
            then it extends continuously to a map
            \begin{align*}
                T : \TemperedDistributions {\R^n} \to \SmoothFunctions {\R^n}.
            \end{align*}
        \item If $T_1 = \Op [\R^n] (\sigma_1) \in \OperatorClass {m_1} {\rho, \delta}$ and $T_2 = \Op [\R^n] (\sigma_2) \in \OperatorClass {m_2} {\rho, \delta}$,
            then we have
            \begin{align*}
                T_1 \circ T_2
                = \Op [\R^n] (\sigma_1 \circ \sigma_2)
                \quad \text{ mod }\ \SmoothingOperators [\R^n].
            \end{align*}

            In particular,
            the composition of an operator in $\OperatorClass [\R^n] {m_1} {\rho, \delta}$
            with an operator in $\OperatorClass [\R^n] {m_2} {\rho, \delta}$
            yields an operator in $\OperatorClass [\R^n] {m_1 + m_2} {\rho, \delta}$.
        \item If $T = \Op(\sigma) \in \OperatorClass [\R^n] m {\rho, \delta}$,
            then its adjoint satisfies
            \begin{align*}
                \adj T
                = \Op [\R^n] (\sigma^{(*)})
                \quad \text{ mod }\ \SmoothingOperators [\R^n].
            \end{align*}

            In particular,
            $\OperatorClass [\R^n] m {\rho, \delta}$ is stable under taking the adjoint.
        \item $T = \Op [\R^n] (\sigma) \in \OperatorClass [\R^n] m {\rho, \delta}$
            has an inverse modulo $\SmoothingOperators [\R^n]$
            if and only if $\sigma$ is \emph{elliptic}.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\section{Generalisation to other Lie groups}

It would be desirable to have a symbolic calculus on other settings as well.
Naturally, that setting should have a \emph{differential structure} and a \emph{Fourier transform}.
% TODO Add requirements

It follows that we should aim to establish a pseudo-differential calculus on \emph{locally compact Lie groups with polynomial growth}.

\subsection{The abelian case}

Naturally, the first Lie groups for which we seek to establish a pseudo-differential calculus is that of \emph{abelian group}
As their irreducible representations are \emph{one-dimensional} (see e.g.~\cite[Corollary 6.3.26]{RuzhanskyTurunen10}),
the Fourier analysis becomes considerably simpler.
Since all abelian Lie groups are isomorphic to $\R^m \times \T^n$,
we need only treat the case of $\T^n$.

This time,
the Fourier transform is the classical Fourier series,
and differential operators act like their \emph{discrete} characteristic polynomial (i.e. restricted to $\Z^n$).
As a result,
a differential operator $T$ arising from a discrete polynomial $\sigma(x, \xi)$ is written
\begin{align*}
    T \defeq \sum_{\abs \alpha \leq N} \frac 1 {\alpha!} \DifferenceOperatorOrder [\T^n] \alpha \sigma_1(x, 0) \iD{x^\alpha},
\end{align*}
so that~\eqref{eq:composition_formula_for_characteristic_polynomials} becomes
\begin{align}
    \sigma_3(x, \xi) = \sum_{\alpha \in \N^n} \frac 1 {\alpha!} \DifferenceOperatorOrder [\T^n] \alpha \sigma_1(x, \xi) \iD{x^\alpha} \sigma_2(x, \xi)
    \label{eq:composition_formula_for_discrete_characteristic_polynomials}
\end{align}

A symbolic calculus is obtained in a similar fashion as $\R^n$,
with discrete differences instead of derivatives in $\xi$.
In fact, the proofs are either identical to the classcial Euclidean case,
or considerably simplified by the compactness of $\T^n$.

\subsection{Compact groups}

As the first non-specific case,
a difficulty that arises is how to replace $\DifferenceOperatorOrder [\T^n] \alpha$ and $\iD{\xi^\alpha}$
in~\eqref{eq:composition_formula_for_characteristic_polynomials} and~\eqref{eq:composition_formula_for_discrete_characteristic_polynomials} respectively.

It was observed in~\cite{RuzhanskyTurunen10}
that we could generalise the above operators

\subsection{Graded Lie groups}

\section{The motion group}

Good examples of locally compact Lie group that are neither \emph{abelian} nor \emph{compact} are the \emph{motion groups}, i.e.
\begin{align*}
    \Group \defeq \R^n \ltimes \SpecialOrthogonalGroup n,
\end{align*}
and they will be the object of the present thesis.
Note that $\Group$ can equivalently defined as the \emph{smallest group of affine transformations that contains both rotations and translations}.

In addition to the fact that it is one of the simplest groups on which symbolic calculus had not been developed,
it also appears naturally in applications in fields such as biology and robotics.
In fact, those fields have started using the Fourier Transform on $\Group$ as a mean to solve convolution and partial differential equations,
like the paper \cite{ChirikjianKyatkin00} shows.

Our aim is to show the following.

\begin{theorem}[Pseudo-differential calculus on the motion group]
    Suppose that $G$ is the smallest subgroup of affine transformations of the Euclidean space
    which contains both translations and rotations.

    We can define a collection $(\OperatorClass m {})_{m \in \R}$
    of sets of operators
    which satisfies the following properties.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If $X$ is a left-invariant vector field on $\Group$,
            then $X \in \OperatorClass 1 {}$.
        \item For every $m \in \R$, $\OperatorClass m {}$ is stable under taking the \emph{adjoint}.
        \item If $T_1 \in \OperatorClass {m_1} {}$ and $T_2 \in \OperatorClass {m_2} {}$, then the \emph{composition} $T_1 \circ T_2$ belongs to $\OperatorClass {m_1 + m_1} {}$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
