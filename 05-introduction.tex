\chapter{Introduction}

Since their inception in the 1960s,
pseudo-differential operators have become standard tools in the study of partial differential equations.
On $\R^n$,
these operators are defined \emph{globally} as arising from smooth maps called \emph{symbols} via the Euclidean Fourier Transform.

While pseudo-differential operators can be defined locally on any connected manifold,
two issues arise.
Firstly,
our operators can only be defined provided that a condition such as
\begin{align*}
    1 - \rho \leq \delta < \rho
\end{align*}
holds (see e.g.~\cite[Section 4]{Shubin01}),
while their Euclidean counterparts make sense without restriction on $\rho$ and $\delta$.
Secondly,
a global notion of \emph{symbol} cannot be invariantly defined.

The first successful attempt at defining a global pseudo-differential calculus
on a non-Euclidean manifold is due to \citeauthor{RuzhanskyTurunen10},
and their treatment of compact Lie groups.
They defined the global symbol of an operator via the group Fourier transform of the right-convolution kernel,
which in particular is  \emph{matrix}-valued
due to the non-commutativity of the group law.
Particularly instrumental to their success was their definition of \emph{difference operators},
which generalises derivatives in Fourier variables from the Euclidean case.
It is worth remembering that,
while good properties of left-invariant pseudo-differential operators
are ensured by the Plancherel theory,
it is the estimates on the derivatives of the symbol and thus in the Fourier variables,
that extend the desired properties onto more general pseudo-differential operators.
More specifically,
their concepts of difference operators allowed them to firstly ensure pseudo-differential operators
have Calder\'on-Zygmund kernels,
and secondly control the order of the terms that appear in asymptotic sums
arising from the composition and adjunction of operators.

It is natural to wonder whether a global pseudo-differential calculus can be defined on other,
more complicated, settings.
To this end,
we observe that the Ruzhansky-Turunen theory relies on a Fourier-Plancherel theory,
while good properties of the operators rely on an understanding of the theory of singular integrals.
Therefore,
the natural settings to investigate are Lie groups with polynomial volume growth.

In 2013,
\citeauthor{FischerRuzhansky12} treated the case of graded nilpotent Lie groups.
In particular,
they dealt with the technical issues which arise from working with infinite-dimensional representations,
and more crucially,
non-central sub-Laplacians or Rockland operators.
They also present a strategy to obtain the composition and adjunction formulae,
which consists of proving symbolic estimates on the functional calculus for the sub-Laplacian or the Rockland operator,
and subsequently proving kernel estimates for general symbols.

The aim of this thesis is to study the case of the Euclidean motion group,
which is the smallest group of affine transformations containing both translations and rotations.
Our analysis will encounter difficulties due to the absence of properties such as compactness and commutativity of the group law,
and the lack of a dilation structure.
Furthermore, the infinite dimensional nature of the representations
and the fact that the Laplacian is not central also complicates matters.
Nevertheless, our interest in this group is justified for two reasons:
firstly, it is one of the more elementary non-compact groups not yet studied;
secondly, by its very definition,
it naturally describes rigid motions such as the position and orientation of a robot arm or polymer chains like DNA.
As a result,
many partial differential equations from engineering, biology and physics
are naturally expressed on the motion group.
More detail on the different applications can be found in \cite{ChirikjianWang04,ChirikjianKyatkin00,Chirikjian13}.

\section{Survey and outline}

In this section,
we informally discuss an overview of the theory on compact groups and graded Lie groups.
For more detail,
the reader is invited to consult~\cite{RuzhanskyTurunen10} for the compact case
(with the understanding that the composition and adjunction formulae are only fully proved in~\cite{Fischer2015}),
and~\cite{FischerRuzhansky16} for the graded case.
To avoid repetition,
we shall discuss both cases simultaneously,
and contrast them to the case of the motion group when appropriate.

Essentially,
\cite{Fischer2015,FischerRuzhansky16} and the present document
all follow the following steps
to develop a global pseudo-differential calculus.

\begin{description}
    \item[Step 1.] Study the (sub-)Laplacian or Rockland operator,
        and the corresponding Sobolev spaces.
    \item[Step 2.] Define a sufficiently general Fourier Transform.
    \item[Step 3.] Find a family of smooth functions which have a Leibniz-like rule and can be used for a Taylor development.
    \item[Step 4.] Define the symbol classes.
    \item[Step 5.] Functional calculus of the (sub-)Laplacian or Rockland operator.
    \item[Step 6.] Obtain kernel estimates.
    \item[Step 7.] Prove the composition and adjunction formulae.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Fourier analysis}

Our first step is to make sure that our group has a sufficiently general Fourier transform,
so that we can define an analogue of the Euclidean Kohn-Nirenberg quantisation.

On our settings,
the Fourier transform is defined on $\Lebesgue 1 {\Group, \dd g}$ via
\begin{align*}
    \Fourier f(\xi)
    \defeq \int_\Group f(g) \adj{\xi(g)} \dd g,
\end{align*}
where $\dd g$ denotes a \emph{Haar measure},
$\xi \in \dualGroup \Group$,
and $\dualGroup \Group$ is the \emph{unitary dual} of $\Group$,
i.e.\ the set of all equivalence classes of irreducible, strongly continuous and unitary representations of $\Group$.

If $f \in \Lebesgue 1 \Group \cap \Lebesgue 2 \Group$,
we have the following \emph{Plancherel formula}
\begin{align*}
    \int_\Group \abs f^2 \dd g
    = \int_{\dualGroup \Group}
    \tr(\Fourier f(\xi) \adj{\Fourier f(\xi)})
    \dd \mu_{\dualGroup \Group}(\xi),
\end{align*}
where $\dd \mu_{\dualGroup \Group}$ denotes the so-called \emph{Plancherel measure},
while any $f \in \Schwartz \Group$ may be recovered from its Fourier Transform via
the following \emph{inverse formula}
\begin{align*}
    f(g) \defeq
    \int_{\dualGroup \Group}
    \tr(\xi(g) \Fourier f(\xi))
    \dd \mu_{\dualGroup \Group}(\xi),
    \quad g \in \Group.
\end{align*}

The problem of extending the Fourier transform onto Sobolev spaces was solved in~\cite[Subsection 5.1.1]{FischerRuzhansky16}

\subsection*{Difference operators}

In~\cite{RuzhanskyTurunen10},
\citeauthor{RuzhanskyTurunen10} introduce the following notion of difference operator
If $q \in \SmoothFunctions \Group$,
we define
\begin{align*}
    \DifferenceOperator [\Group] q \Fourier f = \Fourier \{q f\}.
\end{align*}

We need to find a family of functions
\begin{align*}
    \Delta \defeq \{q_1, \dots, \q_{\dimDifferenceOperators} \in \SmoothFunctions \Group\}
\end{align*}
with respect to which to take difference operators.
The main requirements are the following.
\begin{itemize}
    \item We can use a \emph{Taylor development} at the origin.
        This is due to the fact that the adjunction and the composition cannot be expressed on the symbolic side without using a Taylor development.
    \item We have a reasonable \emph{Leibniz rule}.
        This ensures for example that the order of the composition of two left-invariant pseudo-differential operators is the sum of the orders.
    \item Ensure our pseudo-differentials of order $0$ are \emph{Calder\'on-Zygmund}.
        While we can reasonably expect the Plancherel theory to ensure boundedness $\Lebesgue 2 \Group$,
        we rely on the theory of singular integrals to have the boundedness on $\Lebesgue p \Group$.
\end{itemize}

The first couple of conditions naturally require that each $q_j$ vanish at $e_\Group$ and that $\{dq_j(e) : 1 \leq j \leq \dimDifferenceOperators\}$ span the tangent space $T_{e_\Group} G$.
Such a family is called \emph{admissible} in~\cite{RuzhanskyTurunenWirth10} and subsequent literature.

Intuitively,
our definition of symbol classes will ensure that the regularity of the kernel will increase every time we multiply it by one of the $q_j \in \Delta$,
exactly like in the Euclidean case.
In particular,
this means that our kernels must be smooth outside of
\begin{align}
    \bigcap_{q \in \Delta} \{q = 0\},
    \label{eq:common_zeros_of_difference_operators}
\end{align}
while the above set may contain singularities.
However,
the Calder\'on-Zygmund theory requires that the singularity be confined to the identity.
Therefore,
\cite{RuzhanskyTurunenWirth10} defines $\Delta$ to be \emph{strongly admissible}
if~\eqref{eq:common_zeros_of_difference_operators} equals $\{e_\Group\}$.

\subsection*{Functional calculus}

A crucial step of our analysis is to construct a family of smoothing symbols approximating the identity symbol.
Using the algebra structure of our symbol classes,
this will yield an important density result,
as we will be able to approximate any symbol with smoothing symbols.

Ideally,
we want to create a family $\{\eta_\epsilon = \Fourier p_\epsilon\}_{\epsilon \in (0, 1]} \subset \SmoothingSymbols$
such that
\begin{align*}
    \SymbolSemiNorm m {\rho, \delta} N {\eta_\epsilon}
    &\leq \epsilon^\frac m \nu,
    \quad m < 0,\\
    \SymbolSemiNorm m {\rho, \delta} N {\Id {} - \eta_\epsilon}
    &\leq \epsilon^\frac m \nu,
    \quad m \geq 0.
\end{align*}
where $\nu$ is the order of the sub-Laplacian or Rockland operator.
Moreover,
to prove the Calder\'on-Zygmund property,
we need very good estimates on the kernels $p_\epsilon$.
This implies that the best candidate is the Fourier transform of the \emph{heat kernel}.

The family of symbols is used in the following proofs.
\begin{description}
    \item[Kernel estimates]

        Given a symbol $\sigma \in \SymbolClass m {\rho, \delta}$,
        we estimate the singularity of its kernel at the origin via
        \begin{align*}
            \abs {\kappa_g(h)}
            \leq
            \abs {\conv {\kappa_g} {p_\epsilon}(h)}
            +
            \abs {\conv {\kappa_g} {(\delta_{e_\Group} - p_\epsilon)(h)}}
        \end{align*}

        The second term of the right-hand side is the one containing the singularity,
        and we need good estimates to control it.

    \item[Construction of asymptotic limits]

        One of the inherent characteristics of symbolic calculus is that compositions and adjunctions can only be expressed via infinite sums from which we cannot reasonably expect convergence.

        As certain applications such as the construction of parametrices rely on making sense of these sums in a suitable sense,
        it is important that we define a notion of \emph{asymptotic convergence}.

        The idea is the same as in the Euclidean case.
        We know that cutting off ``low frequencies'' will not affect the result modulo $\SmoothingSymbols$,

        Given a sequence of symbols $\sigma_j$ with strictly decreasing order,
        we thus define
        \begin{align*}
            \sum_{j = 0}^{+\infty} \sigma_j \defsim
            \sum_{j = 0}^{+\infty} \sigma_j (\Id {} - \eta_{\epsilon_j})
            \quad \text{modulo } \SmoothingSymbols,
        \end{align*}
        for a well chosen sequence $(\epsilon_j) \subset (0, 1]$ decreasing to $0$.

    \item[Density of smoothing symbols]

        Letting
        \begin{align*}
            \sigma_\epsilon \defeq \sigma \eta_\epsilon
        \end{align*}
        allows us to approximate $\sigma$ by smoothing symbols,
        while the error term
        \begin{align*}
            \sigma - \sigma_\epsilon = (\Id {} - \eta_\epsilon) \sigma
        \end{align*}
        can be controlled via our symbolic estimates on $\Id {} - \eta_\epsilon$.

        In particular,
        this allow us to reduce to proving that the composition or adjunction of operators on the symbolic side
        holds true for smoothing symbols with the appropriate symbol seminorms.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{The graded case}

The existence of such a family $\eta_\epsilon$ is ensured directly by the \emph{Hulanicki Theorem} (see \cite[Theorem 4.5.1]{FischerRuzhansky16}).
We can define
\begin{align*}
    \eta_\epsilon \defeq \Fourier \{\e^{-t \mathcal R} \delta_{e_\Group}\},
\end{align*}
where $\mathcal R$ is a positive Rockland operator,
and the aforementioned theorem ensures that this defines a smoothing symbol satisfying the appropriate symbolic estimates.

\subsubsection{The compact case}

Following~\cite{FurioliMelziVeneruso06},
\citeauthor{Fischer2015} shows symbolic estimates for the functional calculus of the Laplace-Beltrami operator in~\cite{Fischer2015}.
However, as her functional calculus only covers functions with compact support,
she lets
\begin{align*}
    \eta_\epsilon
    \defeq \chi(\epsilon \xi(\Laplacian [\Group])),
\end{align*}
where $\chi : \R^+ \to \R$ equals $1$ on $[0, 1]$ and has compact support.
To estimate the remainder,
she uses a \emph{Littlewood-Paley} decomposition
\begin{align*}
    \Id {} - \eta_\epsilon = \sum_{j = 1}^{+\infty} \eta_{\epsilon, j},
\end{align*}
where $\eta_{\epsilon, j} \defeq \eta_{2^{-j} \epsilon} - \eta_{2^{-j + 1} \epsilon}$
and the convergence is understood in the strong operator topology.

\subsubsection{The motion group}

Following the ideas of~\cite{Shubin01, RuzhanskyWirth14},
I define
\begin{align*}
    \eta_\epsilon(\xi) \defeq
    \int_\Gamma \e^{-t z} \left(\xi(\Id {} - \Laplacian) - z \Id {}\right)^{-1} \dd z,
    \quad \xi \in \dualGroup \Group
\end{align*}
with an appropriate contour $\Gamma \subset \C$
and I show the symbolic estimates on $\eta_\epsilon$ and $\Id {} - \eta_\epsilon$
via the exponential decay on the contour and elementary estimates on the resolvent,
in particular without using the classical estimates on the heat kernel.

This approach has (at least) two drawbacks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item
        We only show symbolic estimates for the functional calculus associated with the functions $\e^{t z}$,
        $1 - \e^{t z}$, and $z^\gamma$,
        while~\cite{FischerRuzhansky16} and~\cite{Fischer2015} prove a much more general result in their respective cases.
        Although this is not necessary to obtain the calculus,
        it is an interesting result in itself.
    \item
        The kernel estimates when $\rho = 1$,
        essential to show the Calder\'on-Zygmund property,
        are trickier to obtain
        and will require better estimates on the kernel.
        As a result,
        we will have to follow~\cite{Fischer2015} to
        to prove the $\Lebesgue p \Group$ boundedness.
\end{itemize}

It is nevertheless interesting to observe that a pseudo-differential calculus can be constructed with relatively little functional calculus,
which is the reasoning behind this approach.
