\chapter{Towards groups with polynomial growth}

In this chapter,
$\Group$ will denote a connected locally compact Lie group,
for which we fix a non-zero left-invariant Haar measure $\mu = \dd g$.
Moreover,
we shall assume that $\Group$ has \emph{polynomial growth},
in the sense of the following definition.

\begin{definition}[Group of polynomial growth]
    We shall say that $\Group$ has \emph{polynomial growth}
    if for every compact neighbourhood $U \subset \Group$
    containing the identity $e_\Group$,
    there exists $C \geq 0$ such that
    \begin{align*}
        \mu(U^n) \leq C n^C
    \end{align*}
    for every $n \in \N$.
\end{definition}

This implies that $\Group$ is unimodular.
