\chapter{Towards groups with polynomial growth}

\section{The setting}

In this chapter,
$\Group$ will denote a connected locally compact Lie group,
for which we fix a non-zero left-invariant Haar measure $\mu = \dd g$.
Moreover,
we shall assume that $\Group$ has \emph{polynomial growth},
in the sense of the following definition.

\begin{definition}[Group of polynomial growth]
    We shall say that $\Group$ has \emph{polynomial growth}
    if for every compact neighbourhood $U \subset \Group$
    containing the identity $e_\Group$,
    there exists $C \geq 0$ such that
    \begin{align*}
        \mu(U^n) \leq C n^C
    \end{align*}
    for every $n \in \N$.
\end{definition}

This implies that $\Group$ is unimodular.

\section{The heat kernel}

\section{Kernel estimates}

First,
let us lower the requirement that we need a Littlewood-Paley decomposition
to prove the kernel estimates.

\begin{theorem}[Kernel estimates at the origin]
    Assume that $1 \geq \rho \geq \delta \geq 0$ with $\rho \neq 0$.

    Suppose there exists a family $(h_t)_{t \in (0, 1]} \subset \Schwartz \Group$
    satisfying the following properties.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item As $t$ tend to $0$, $h_t$ converges to $\delta_{e_\Group}$.
        \item If $q \in \SmoothFunctions {\Group}$ vanishes up to order $a \in \N$,
            then for each $s \in \R$ there exists $C \geq 0$ such that
            \begin{align*}
                \norm [\KernelsSobolev s {s - m}] {q h_t}
                \leq C t^{m - \rho a}
            \end{align*}
            holds for every $0 < t \leq 1$.
    \end{itemize}

    If $\kappa \in \TemperedDistributions \Group$ satisfies
    \begin{align*}
        q \kappa \in \Sobolev \gamma,
        \quad \gamma < -\frac n 2 -m + \rho a
    \end{align*}
    whenever $q$ vanishes up to order $a$ and $m > -n$,
    then
    \begin{align*}
        \abs{\kappa(g)} \leq C \norm [\Group] h^{-\frac{m + n} \rho}.
    \end{align*}
\end{theorem}
