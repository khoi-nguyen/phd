\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

Firstly, I would like to thank my parents, my sister and her partner for everything they have done for me.
They have always been there for me,
in good and bad times alike.
They have pushed and encouraged me throughout my life,
and have always done their best to make sure that I did not need to worry about anything else when I had to work or study.

I would also like to take the opportunity that these pages provide to thank Karen, Paul, Paula, Mike, Emma and Richard.
When being far away from my own family was difficult,
they were always there and have always gone out of their ways to make me feel part of the family.
From inviting me to spend Christmas or Easter with them,
to smaller everyday life gestures,
I am truly grateful for everything they have done for Chloe and me.

During my eight years of studying mathematics,
I feel very fortunate to have spent the first three at \emph{Universit\'e Catholique de Louvain}.
What I appreciated the most was the effort that the lecturers made to look at
whether known results and concepts could be introduced or proved more easily,
as opposed to present it as they had learnt it themselves.
I will always remember Jean Van Schaftingen's and Augusto Ponce's elegant modification of McShane's definition of the Lebesgue integral,
Michel Willem's way of deriving all the convexity and duality results of Lebesgue spaces in \emph{one} corollary,
and the countless examples that made my education different than it would have been at any other institution.
They taught me to appreciate mathematical results,
but also to see the beauty in \emph{how} you obtain them.
In addition to their teaching duties,
they have often taken the time to help and advise me.
In particular,
I would like to thank Dr.\ Laurent Moonens,
Prof.\ Augusto Ponce, Prof.\ Jean Van Schaftingen and Prof.\ Pierre Bieliavsky for writing the recommendation letters which have allowed me to study here in the United Kingdom.

I would like to express my eternal gratitude to V\'eronique Fischer for the numerous hours she spent examining my proofs,
reading sections of my thesis and generating new ideas,
and for all the meetings and Skype calls,
even after she had left her position at Imperial College.
Her extensive knowledge of my PhD topic and related areas proved invaluable and
I cannot imagine having completed the PhD without the vast amount of help which she so generously gave me.
Her words of encouragement and belief in me were also of great help at times of difficulty.

Last but not least,
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor,
Professor Michael Ruzhansky,
for giving me the opportunity to work with him and for his continuous support, patience, motivation and insight.
