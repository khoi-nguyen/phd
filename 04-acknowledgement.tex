\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

Last but not least,
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor,
Professor Michael Ruzhansky,
for giving me the opportunity to work with him and for his continuous support, patience, motivation and insight.
I could not have completed this PhD without his belief in my abilities and words of encouragement.
