\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

Firstly, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to:
my parents, Son Nguyen and Lien To; my sister and her partner, Anh Nguyen and Nicolas Odent; and the rest of my family,
all of whom have been an invaluable support throughout my studies and my life in general.
I would also like to thank my girlfriend, Chloe Mason,
for always believing in me and for typing for me when my hands were too painful.
I would also like to thank Chloe's parents for encouraging me throughout.

During my eight years of studying mathematics,
I feel very fortunate to have spent the first three at \emph{Universit\'e Catholique de Louvain}.
What I appreciated the most was the effort that the lecturers made to look at
whether known results and concepts could be introduced or proved more easily,
as opposed to present it as they had learnt it themselves.
I will always remember Jean Van Schaftingen's and Augusto Ponce's elegant modification of McShane's definition of the Lebesgue integral,
Michel Willem's way of deriving all the convexity and duality results of Lebesgue spaces in \emph{one} corollary,
and the countless examples that my education different than what it would have been at any other institution.
They taught me to appreciate mathematical results,
but also to see the beauty in \emph{how} you obtain them.
In addition to their teaching duties,
they have often taken the time to help and advise me.
In particular,
I would like to thank Dr.\ Laurent Moonens,
Prof.\ Augusto Ponce, Prof.\ Jean Van Schaftingen and Prof.\ Pierre Bieliavsky for writing the recommendation letters which have allowed me to study here in the United Kingdom.

I would like to express my eternal gratitude to V\'eronique Fischer for the numerous hours she spent examining my proofs,
reading sections of my thesis and generating new ideas,
and for all the meetings and Skype calls,
even after she had left her position at Imperial College.
Her extensive knowledge of my PhD topic and related areas proved invaluable and
I cannot imagine having completed the PhD without the vast amount of help which she so generously gave me.
Her words of encouragement and belief in me were also of great help at times of difficulty.

Last but not least,
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor,
Professor Michael Ruzhansky,
for giving me the opportunity to work with him and for his continuous support, patience, motivation and insight.
