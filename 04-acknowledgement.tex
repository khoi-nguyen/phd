\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

My profound thanks also go to Pierre Bieliavsky and the three professors aforementioned,
all from Universit\'e Catholique de Louvain,
for their kind and generous words when writing my recommendation letters,
which afforded me the opportunity to realise my dream of studying in the UK.

I would like to express my eternal gratitude to Veronique Fischer for the numerous hours she spent examining my proofs,
reading sections of my thesis and generating new ideas,
and for all the meetings and Skype calls,
even after she had left her position at Imperial College.
Her extensive knowledge of my PhD topic and related areas proved invaluable and I cannot imagine having completed the PhD without the vast amount of help which she so generously gave me.
Her words of encouragement and belief in me were also of great help at times of difficulty.

Last but not least,
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor,
Professor Michael Ruzhansky,
for giving me the opportunity to work with him and for his continuous support, patience, motivation and insight.
