\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

Many teachers and professors contributed a great deal to my education,
and I will aways be grateful to them.
Some had more of an impact than others,
and I would like to seize the opportunity that those pages provide me to thank them.
The two people who in my opinion have influenced me the most mathematically are Jean Van Schaftingen and Augusto Ponce.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Michael Ruzhansky
    \item Veronique Fischer
    \item Augusto Ponce, Laurent Moonens, Jean Van Schaftingen, Pierre Bieliavsky
    \item Chloe
    \item Family
