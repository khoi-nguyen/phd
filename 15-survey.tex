\section{The compact case}

In this section,
$\CompactGroup$ denotes a \emph{connected, compact Lie group}.
We equip $\CompactGroup$ with the unique normalized bi-invariant Riemannian metric,
and denote the corresponding Laplace-Beltrami operator by $\Laplacian [\CompactGroup]$.

The description of the unitary dual is given by the following \emph{Peter-Weyl theorem}.
