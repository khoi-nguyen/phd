\section{The compact case}

In this section,
$\CompactGroup$ denotes a \emph{connected, compact Lie group}.
We equip $\CompactGroup$ with the unique normalized bi-invariant Riemannian metric,
and denote the corresponding Laplace-Beltrami operator by $\Laplacian [\CompactGroup]$.

The description of the unitary dual is given by the following \emph{Peter-Weyl theorem}.

\begin{theorem}[Peter-Weyl theorem]
\label{theorem:Peter-Weyl_theorem}
    Let $\CompactGroup$ be a compact topological group.
    The unitary dual $\dualGroup \CompactGroup$ of $\Groups$ is discrete and
    the set
    \begin{align*}
        \left\{
            \sqrt{\dimRep\tau} \tau_{ij} : \tau \in \dualGroup\CompactGroup,\ i, j = 1, \dots, \dimRep\tau
        \right\}
    \end{align*}
    is an orthonormal basis of $\Lebesgue{2}{\CompactGroup}$ with respect to the \emph{normalised} Haar measure.
\end{theorem}
